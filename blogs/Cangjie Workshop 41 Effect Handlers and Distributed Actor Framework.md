# Cangjie Workshop #41: Effect Handlers & Distributed Actor Framework

In this session, researchers from Huawei's Programming Language Lab in Edinburgh share cutting-edge features for concurrent and distributed programming in Cangjie.

## Topics Covered

### Effect Handlers in Cangjie — Dr. Magnus Morton

A deep dive into effect handlers, a powerful new language feature for managing side effects. Learn how resumable exceptions work, the difference between immediate and deferred handlers, and practical applications like memoization and dependency injection.

### Distributed Actor Framework — Dr. Steven Cheung

An introduction to Cangjie's actor-based concurrency model. Discover how to eliminate data races with async message passing, build distributed systems with client-server and cluster APIs, and integrate actors as MCP tools for AI agents.

### Codec Implementation — Mr. Jingrun Wu

A technical overview of a binary codec designed for server middleware, supporting 16 data types with compact encoding for high-performance communication.
