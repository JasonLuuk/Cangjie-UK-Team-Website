Range

A range is used to represent a sequence with a fixed step and is denoted by Range<T>.

The for-in expression can be used to traverse a range the same way it can be used to traverse an Array.

There are 2 ways to initialize a range, examples shown, either Range<T> or Literal.

Ranges are iterable, use the iterator structure below to experiment with their capabilities.
