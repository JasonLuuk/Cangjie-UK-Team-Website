Hello World

This first program prints "Hello World".

Your main function does not need the modifier func.

To run the program, copy the code to a .cj file of your choice and run 
>>cjc filename.cj -o filename
You will then have an executable. Alternatively, 
>>cjc filename.cj creates an executable called main.
