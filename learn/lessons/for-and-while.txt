For and while loops


Cangjie has both while and for loops.
While the condition enclosed remains true, the loop runs




for loop =>  j iterates 0 through to 3 exclusive



for loop =>  j iterates 0 through to 3 inclusive









Cangjie uses pattern matching to iterate through the array





loop that only runs on values of j when the where condition is satisfied




when the iterator variable is not of concern, use the wildcard variable "_" to iterate the loop
