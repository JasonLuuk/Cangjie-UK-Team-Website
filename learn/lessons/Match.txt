Match

Match expressions use pattern matching in the following ways:

"|" is used to connect multiple patterns.

The wildcard pattern is defined by a "_".






Cangjie also supports binding patterns, as demonstrated.
Binding cannot be used with the | connection, this throws an error.

For each case branch, the scope level of variables after => is the same as that of variables introduced before =>.
This means that we need to be careful not to define variables with already used identifiers, additionally, having the same identifier for different variables in a tuple pattern will raise an error.






















Finally, we can also use a type pattern, in this example we see that the object b is of class Brightness defined earlier.
