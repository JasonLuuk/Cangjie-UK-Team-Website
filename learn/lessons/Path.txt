Path

The fs pacage provides functions to parse and construct file paths in a way that is portable between
operating systems (hopefully); dir/file on Linux vs. dir\file on Windows, for example.

For more functionality refer to:

Join should be used to construct paths in a portable way. First we call the constrcutor, then we chain the "join" calls to construct a hierarchical path from them.


The Path struct can operate on any of the following: //,/,\.
For those confused, .. is a parent directory.

We also have a function that given a Path, returns Option<Path>, which includes all the directories in hierarchical order.

fileName, as name suggests, returns the name of the file at the end of the path.


We can check whether a path is absolute. 





We can extract extension from a Path (we extract it from the filename to be exact).
We can also get name without the extension at all.
